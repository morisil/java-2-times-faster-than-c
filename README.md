:warning: The title of this project is provocative, and it is meant to be, to bring
attention to certain ideas. Please read through this document before jumping to any conclusions.
For now I will just say that the title applies just to the algorithm presented here, not to
Java and C in general. I am also the farthest away from convincing anyone to choose Java
over any other language, and I even see good reasons to discourage you from using Java in
plethora of cases. I rarely code Java myself these days.


## My typical dialog from the past days

> "Your code running on virtual machine will be ALWAYS slower than equivalent native code."
> 
> "Why?"
> 
> "Because of automatic memory management."
> 
> "Why is it so?"
> 
> "Things like automatic memory management ALWAYS add additional overhead to execution."
> 
> "Hmm, let me try, here is a code in Java, and direct equivalent in C,
> the first one is almost 2 times faster."
> 
> "It's because you are doing things wrong. No one would write C code like this."
> 
> "Why?"
> 
> "Because you need to properly manage your memory for efficiency."
> 
> "How do you do it?"
> 
> "Depending on your problem, sometimes even by adding automatic memory management."
> 
> "Ok, so did you just make contradictory statements?"
> 
> "I don't think so, just add these few lines to your code."
> 
> "Do you think it's still the same algorithm afterwards?"
> 
> "Yeah."
> 
> "But is your memory management solution adjusted to this specific C code and
> therefore extending the algorithm?"
> 
> "Yeah."
> 
> "So it's no longer algorithmically equivalent code, isn't it?"
> 
> "Yeah."
> 
> "Did you just make contradictory statements again?"
> 
> "I don't think so."


## Show me the code

The code is almost the same in both languages, still using typical conventions of both of them:

* [Java2TimesFasterThanC.java](src/main/java/com/xemantic/test/howfast/Java2TimesFasterThanC.java)
* [java_2_times_faster_than_c.c](src/main/c/java_2_times_faster_than_c.c)
* [java_faster_than_go.go](src/main/go/java_faster_than_go.go)


I am pretty convinced that algorithmically they are equal, except for obvious explicit memory
releasing in C version. Here is an
[old but comprehensive article](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-jtp09275/index.html)
shedding some light on my results.

I haven't written any C code for 2 decades and it was nice to write some now, to rediscover how
close and influenced Java actually is by C, and how it is designed to run surprisingly close
to the hardware (primitive data types). The code is establishing a ring of nodes first, and then
traversing it continuously while deleting nodes in one direction and inserting them in another.


## Speeding up C version

My example is pushing things to absurd, for a reason. Of course it is possible to outperform
Java version by managing memory better in C. But it would imply embedding additional algorithms
of memory management into my original code, therefore I wouldn't call it "equivalent" anymore
in algorithmic sense. 

I've received amazing feedback showing me how to achieve extremely efficient memory management
in C, for example in ticket [#1](../../issues/1), and I am grateful for this contribution and opportunity
to learn. But still I see no good reasons to alter the C code of this project, maybe
rather extending the algorithm to allocate nodes holding additional payload of variable size,
because it was my initial idea, which I skipped for the sake of simplicity, but now I see that it
was a mistake somehow obscuring what I actually have in mind.

And here is my hypothesis:

**Certain classes of algorithms can gain extra performance just thanks to the fact of being
expressed in the language assuming automatic memory management.**

My experience of writing complex distributed systems, and also my intuition, tells me that
they are pretty common, and I have a feeling that these cases are rarely covered in microbenchmarks.
If there is a minimal thing I want to achieve with this experiment, it is to convince myself
and the others, to always question certain dogmas of modern software development and validity
of certain arguments in given context. Please check issue [#2](../../issues/2) as an example of what I am referring to.


## Speeding up GO version

Following the same aspiration of speeding up C version , is to keep the code simplistic as possible
as you can see running the code with profiler (add --cpuprofile=./profile.out) ,time spent mostly on object allocation and GC.
At the code level we can optimize the datastructure and allocation alongside fine tune the initial garbage collection target percentage
or take control of the GC and run it manually. 


## Does it have any practical implications?

It does not, except from methodological perspective it seems to falsify certain statements with 
generalized quantifiers. So it becomes rather something like:

"Your algorithm written in code designed to run on a virtual machine will be usually slower than
equivalent native code."

"always", becomes "usually", and "usually" implies that from now on we should rather revalidate for
each case than make categorical statements.

Common wisdom from microbenchmarks is usually showing JVM to be around 10%-20% percent
slower than the equivalent optimized native code, with big outliers in favor of the
native code. But how do these tests actually compare to real life code where most of the software is
using data structures already standardized for each language?

I don't know of any benchmarks which can objectively measure the effects which I am describing here
in generic way. I don't believe that my experiment can be really scaled. But I believe that the
power of certain algorithmic expressiveness improves the performance
instead of degrading it, like in case of [reactive programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_programming)
paradigm. Of course by principle, at the end of the day, everything can be reduced to machine code,
which can be optimized to extreme in assembly code. But would it be really algorithmically
equivalent? I will leave this question open.

In distributed systems powering the dynamic internet services we are using, the CPU based
performance is usually impacted by IO throughput. Overall performance improvement will come not
from the fact that our code is faster, but from the fact that we are waiting "better",
with less contention, while collecting the garbage in parallel, and while preventing the whole
system from entering the [thrashing state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrashing_(computer_science))
with tools like [circuit breakers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuit_breaker_design_pattern).
If your code represents typical dynamic web stack, with data retrieved from the database, possibly
streamed, and converted to JSON on the fly, each request typically involves myriads of new data
instances of unpreditable size in the pipeline, which are immediately discarded at the end of the
request. The goal is to minimize the response time and virtual machines seem to greatly contribute
to that.


## Myths

Just to recapitulate the myths associated with virtual machines and automatic memory management:

 * code executing on VM is ALWAYS slower than the native one
 * garbage collection is ALWAYS harming the performance
 * garbage collection is causing "stop the world"

None of these seem to be true these days:

 * it seems that the code executing on VM can be actually quite optimal thanks to
   technologies like [HotSpot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HotSpot_(virtual_machine))
 * garbage collection can actually greatly improve the performance of common algorithms
 * on JVM GC is mostly happening as a parallel operation these days


## Should I rewrite all my code in Java now?

Absolutely not!!! Performance is not the only reason why we are choosing given language.
When I started coding in JDK 1.0.2 (the first stable release), it was 20 times slower than
the native code, but the Java code I compiled back then in 1997 still just runs on the
newest JVM of Java 15. I cannot say the same about the code from this time written in Pascal,
Assembler, C, C++. The promise
"[Write once, run anywhere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Write_once,_run_anywhere)", given me by
legendary [Sun Microsystems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Microsystems),
was kept while the whole runtime and toolchain became open source. This is the actual
superpower of Java I want to pay tribute to - it has been helping me in building
complex software systems for years, with the speed of great toolchain of remote debuggers,
statistical profilers and incremental compilers inherent to the design of the language from equally
legendary[James Gosling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Gosling).

I rarely code Java myself these days, rather GLSL, JavaScript, HTML, CSS and Kotlin, the last one
still usually running on JVM, although with JavaScript and native as possible compilation
targets. My IDE runs on JVM as well. Sometimes I transpile Java to JavaScript. Sometimes
I transpile JavaScript to JavaScript. There are plenty of other possible reasons why you
shouldn't use Java:

 * You are proficient in another language.
 * You prefer pure functional programming.
 * JVM-based solutions tend to have higher memory footprint which is disqualifying it in many
   embedded systems.
 * For the code relying mostly on GPU performance gains on CPU might be neglectable.
 * etc.

**But if your solution requires a cluster of 100 servers behind load balancer, then you can maybe
improve average response time from 100ms to 50ms on the same virtual hardware while safely shutting
down half of these machines? It might cut enough Amazon data center costs to hire
2 or 3 more developers :)**

I did this for several organizations in the past, while always improving the performance of the
stack by order of magnitude.

I'm not a big fan of microbenchmarks and language comparisons which are often biased and
misleading without the context, therefore fueling "holy crusades" and "genital measurement contests".
But I'm a natural born iconoclast, always eager to compare the myth with the reality. And 
in reality you will often hear "arguments from performance" which are equally often
irrelevant to the context they are expressed in. Language is just a tool. Spoken is often
cherished on the altar of national ideology and computer ones are often becoming a fetish
of our idiosyncrasy which we impose on the others. We can do better.

From my experience of leading brilliant software teams I've learned that the actual quality
change in performance does not come from particular technology, but rather from the paradigm
shift in the architecture of the whole system. Technologies like JVM might be a tool of
improvement, but they can also be misused terribly.

## Future research

I would like to test equivalent code with some other languages:

 * Rust
 * C#
 * Kotlin on JVM  
 * JavaScript on node and in the browser
 * Kotlin transpiled to JS also on node and in the browser

Any contributions are welcome.
